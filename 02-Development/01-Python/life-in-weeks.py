"""Instructions
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
age_as_int = int(age)
life_span = 90
age_left = life_span - age_as_int
days_remaining = age_left * 365
weeks_remaining = age_left * 52
months_remaining = age_left * 12
print(f"You have {days_remaining} days, {weeks_remaining} weeks, and {months_remaining} months left.")
